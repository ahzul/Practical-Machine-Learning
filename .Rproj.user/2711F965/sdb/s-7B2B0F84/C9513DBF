The five ways, as described in the study, were “exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E). Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.”\n\nUltimately, the prediction model is to be run on the test data to predict the outcome of 20 different test cases.\n",
